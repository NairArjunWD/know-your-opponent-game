## How to Play

This is a historical fighting game where to land a successful attack, you need to answer the trivia question correctly. However, the trivia question will not be on your own character, but that of your opponent's; each correct answer is a successful strike on the enemy.

## Character Selection

There are 6 historical figures in this game. 

1. Flavius Belisarius
2. Gius Octavius Augustus Caeser
3. Napoleon Bonaparte !
4. Oda Nobunaga !
5. Attila the Hun !
6. Harald Hardrada !

Once a character is chosen, their character selection will disappear. Once both people select their character, they're be taken to the battle screen. Each person will have their character's portrait with a list of lines they'll say depending on the situation that is unique to each character. I was not able to get this to work.

## Gameplay

On the top left corner of their portraits, there's a button that acts as the 'call' command. It repressents you calling your troops so they become prepared at what their command is. Once clicked, the button will drop down the three action buttons. These buttons are your easy, medium, and hard questions. These represent the attack commands you give your troop, such as charging at the enemy or using your archers to barage them instead. Answering each question correctly results in a different amount of points in damage to your opponent depending on difficulty:
 * Easy: -10 HP 
 * Medium: -20 HP
 * Hard: -30 HP

Unfortunately, I didn't get this to work in time.

Once you choose a command for your troops, your question is basically what your spies dug up on your opponent. Answering wrong on a Easy or Medium question will result in a 50% chance of the attacking still damaging your opponenet, but any wrong answer on a hard question will allways be 0%. Each question is based on the enemy character's own life. DUe to this, it's best to not choose a character that you like or are most familiar with, but one you know you're opponent is the least familiar with. Once one player's HP is dropped to zero, their opponent wins the game and that character's victory theme plays. I wasn't able to get this to work, especially since the only characters I even got to work were Augustus and Belisarius.
